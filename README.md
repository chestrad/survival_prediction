# Preoperative CT-Based Deep Learning Model for Predicting Disease-Free Survival in Patients with Lung Adenocarcinomas
This is a repository for a prognosis prediction model for patients with resected lung adenocarcinomas. The CT-based deep learning model output independently predicted disease-free survival for high-risk surgical candidates with clinical stage I lung adenocarcinomas.
